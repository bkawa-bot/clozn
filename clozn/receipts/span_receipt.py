"""span_receipt.py -- SPAN RECEIPTS ("injection forensics"): causally attribute one SPAN of a stored
run's own prompt/context by ablation. "Did THIS sentence in the context change the answer?" -- answered
the same two ways the existing influence receipts answer it, with the same thresholds:

  * REGEN arm (counterfactual text): rebuild the conversation with the span removed from its message and
    regenerate GREEDY through the exact replay path the existing /runs/<id>/receipt regen arm uses
    (clozn.replay.replay.replay with {"greedy": True}) -- baseline-with-span vs ablated-without-span, both
    greedy, both from the run's own stored messages. `has_effect` / `answer_changed` is the same exact
    string comparison _build_receipt uses.
  * FORCED arm (dependence): teacher-force the ORIGINAL answer tokens under the ablated context via the
    existing forced-scoring machinery (clozn.receipts.rederive.score_arm) -- per-continuation-token logprob
    deltas, summarized with forced.py's own `_delta_summary` and judged against forced.py's own thresholds
    (_FORCED_MEAN_THRESHOLD / _FORCED_SUM_THRESHOLD -- never re-invented here). The null floor replaces the
    span with register-matched filler of the SAME character length (forced.py's `_matched_length_filler`,
    the card_filler control's exact recipe) and applies forced.py's `_NULL_FLOOR_RATIO_MIN` ratio test.

OFFSETS ARE CHARACTER OFFSETS, NOT BYTES. `start`/`end` index Unicode code points of the message's
`content` string -- exactly Python `str` slicing (`content[start:end]`), half-open [start, end). Chosen
for JS-friendliness: a frontend that holds the same message text computes them with indexOf/slice rather
than encoding to UTF-8 first. Honest caveat: JavaScript strings count UTF-16 code units, so JS-computed
offsets diverge from code points on astral-plane characters (emoji, rare CJK extensions) -- for BMP text
(ASCII, accented Latin, standard CJK) the two are identical. The `{"find": "<substring>"}` form sidesteps
offset arithmetic entirely and is the recommended wire form for emoji-bearing contexts.

Honesty rules carried over verbatim from the sibling receipts: the regen `note` never claims beyond the
measurement ("removing this span measurably changed / did not change the answer" -- ablation-causal, not
intent); the forced arm carries forced.py's `_FORCED_CAVEAT` unchanged (a nonzero delta is dependence, not
"the answer would have differed", and certainly not "hijacked"); `silent_influence` is core.py's exact
formula (regen text unchanged AND the forced deltas clear the null floor by _NULL_FLOOR_RATIO_MIN).

Never raises into the caller except `SpanSpecError` (an invalid span spec -- the route's 400); a
generation/scoring failure returns None (regen, mirrors receipts.receipt) or a degraded
`causal_verified: False` forced sub-dict (mirrors forced.forced_receipt). Duck-typed against
`sub.chat` / `sub.score_tokens` like replay.py / rederive.py -- fully unit-testable with a fake substrate,
no model, no GPU, no server.
