"""POST /runs/<id>/provenance -- did a STORED run's recorded answer come from the context or the
model's own weights? Runs clozn.analysis.provenance.trace_provenance over the run's own final_prompt
(the exact rendered prompt) + its recorded response -- never a fresh generation, since the question is
about the answer that actually happened, not whatever the model would say greedily today.

NOT self-registering: wire it in clozn/server/app.py by importing this module alongside the other route
families and appending it to _POST_ROUTES (POST-only -- it has no try_get, mirroring span_receipts.py).

CAPABILITY-UNAVAILABLE CHOICE (documented per the task's Gate-0 ask): trace_provenance() itself probes
GET <engine>/health and returns a typed, non-raising {"ok": False, "blocked": "..."} dict -- never an
exception -- when the engine lacks attn_knockout (started without --no-flash-attn), when a requested
focus region is degenerate, or on any other runtime failure (e.g. an unreachable engine). This route
ships that dict straight through as a 200 body (ok: false) rather than mapping it to 503.

Reasoning: 503 in this route family (span_receipts.py, influence_map.py) is reserved for a precondition
the ROUTE itself checks BEFORE ever calling the analysis backend -- "there is no substrate/worker here
at all to even attempt this" (e.g. influence_map.py's `if not (sub and score_tokens): 503`). That is not
this endpoint's situation: the route never inspects engine capabilities itself, it hands the prompt
straight to trace_provenance and that function does its OWN /health probe as part of a normal, completed
call. A completed call that answers "the engine can't do this, and here specifically is why" is a
successful analysis outcome, not a failed HTTP request -- the same distinction influence_map.py draws
between its own 503 ("no worker to try") and 422 ("the backend tried and reported unavailable"). Since
the task's two offered shapes for this endpoint are 200/ok:false or 503, and 503 belongs to the
route-level "nothing to try" precondition this route does not have, 200/ok:false is the one that is
honestly correct here -- it also preserves trace_provenance's own explicit design contract verbatim ("the
product-facing call never raises -- it returns a labeled dict"), and folds three heterogeneous blocked
reasons (missing engine capability, a degenerate/empty focus region, any other runtime exception) under
one status without having to guess which of several non-200 codes best fits all three.
