"""The actuarial journal over HTTP: the full ActuaryReport (GET /journal/actuary), a past-only failure
assessment for one run (POST /runs/<id>/actuary), the OUTCOME-grounded calibration report (GET
/journal/calibration), and calibrated trust spans (POST /runs/<id>/trust_spans).

The default trust-spans read is model-free. Passing ``{"support": true}`` explicitly opts into the
independent local NLI cross-encoder: it checks each span against stored causal-receipt premises when present,
or a plainly labeled active-influence manifest otherwise, and may load that optional model. It never
generates with the audited model, and an unavailable NLI checkpoint stays labeled unavailable rather than
falling back to lexical overlap under the same name.

Two calibration tiers sit side by side, each labelled: /journal/actuary is the PROXY curve (acceptance,
always available, computed on-demand); /journal/calibration is the TRUTH curve (correctness on a labeled
probe set + a selective-generation policy) -- it needs live generation, so it is PERSISTED by
`clozn eval --save` (clozn.eval.store) and served from disk, or available:false until one is saved.

Everything served here inherits actuary.py's honesty stance verbatim: "trusted" is a behavioral PROXY
(the run was kept -- not errored/truncated/test-failed/re-rolled), never a verified-correctness figure.
The dataclass `note` fields ride the wire unchanged, and trust_spans carries calibrated_trust.NOTE at
the top level, so no consumer can read these numbers without the proxy language attached. A journal
with no scored organic runs answers available:false -- absence over an invented curve.

The route module is registered in both product router tables in ``clozn.server.app``. The per-run
failure assessment refits on strictly earlier organic records when timestamps are available, and never
trains on the run id it scores.

The report is cached in-process for 60s (recomputing over a few hundred journal files is cheap but not
free on every poll); every response states its age as "computed_ago_s" so a consumer knows how stale
the curve it was served is.
